        <h2>Uber Donations: Adding a Feature</h2>
        <p>
          There were 6.9 billion Uber rides in 2019. Imagine if each of those rides had been rounded up
          to support charitable causes. Consider if every user opted to round up by just 10 cents per 
          ride, resulting in 690 million dollars donated in a single year.

      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        As a UX/UI Designer with an extensive background in investigative research and psychology, 
        Iâ€™m determined to create new and innovative experiences for users through diligent research, 
        a keen eye for design, and human connections. As a seasoned researcher, I've conducted hundreds 
        of investigations on individuals and entities to help companies make informed business decisions. 
        Creating tangible investigative reports for a variety of clients requires a user-focused mentality, 
        communicating complex information in a concise and digestible manner. As an investigative 
        researcher, I also conducted subject interviews alongside former FBI Agents where I became 
        familiar with interrogatory interview tactics and broadened my understanding of psychology.

        To combine my expertise in research, psychology, and usability with my love of art and design, 
        I decided to further my education by pursuing a UX/UI Design certification where I developed my 
        skills in UX Research, design thinking, usability evaluation, visual design, and user-interaction 
        design.
